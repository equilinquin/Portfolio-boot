                    My name is Elizabeth Garcia-Quilinquin.  I'm orginally from a small island in Hawaii and decided to move out to the Continent for better opportunities.  I have my bachelors degree in science for astronomy, but my work background is very extensive.  I love to learn new things which I've done with my whole working career.  I've worked in retail, hospitality, astronomy outreach/planetarium, customer service, food industry,
                    and now I want to try my hands on coding and computer programing.  I've worked with it in college for classes and worked with some of it for and electronics elective in highschool.  My work ethic will usually speak for itself and for an employer to determine it.  I never try to explain how great of a worker I can be but I always try to prove myself and raise my expectation for myself in a work environment.  I try to learn the basics as quickly as possible and will always have questions later. "There is always room for improvement."
                    <br>
                    Some things about me: I love food, hence I do love to cook.  One reason that I got into the food industry is to try out different food and flavors of different places in the world, and learn about them from different cooks.  I will always try most new things and usually I really love it.  Some say I'm a picky eater but I just want to eat something different everyday.
                    I love books!!! "Zero batteries required".  Although I love to read, my attention is always taken away by the electronics (mostly my phone) for me to appreciate a story.  I'm improving on my reading now because a TV series adaptation is catching up to where I am on with the books now.  I mostly read fiction, romance, and trying to get into science fiction.
                    I zen out to books, music, and app games, but when I want to challenge my mind, I solve puzzles: jiggzaw, sudoku, karuko, mostly number puzzles.  I also like solving crossword puzzles, and it forces me to learn a little something from them when I don't know a solution.
